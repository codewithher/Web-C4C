# Code With Her: Web Coding for Cookies

Welcome! This website serves two functions:

1. A learning playground for Girl Scouts to earn up to 7 badges within the categories of Coding for Good, Cookie Business and Web Designer.
2. A marketing website that will drive cookie sales for the girl scout that made the website.

If you're a Girl Scout, make an account and open up this project in [Replit/Web-C4C](https://replit.com/@HigginsCodes/Web-C4C). More details will be on Google Classroom.
