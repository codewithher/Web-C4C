# Code With Her: Web Coding for Cookies

Welcome! This website serves two functions:

1. A learning playground for Girl Scouts to earn up to 7 badges within the categories of Coding for Good, Cookie Business and Web Designer.
2. A marketing website that will drive cookie sales for the girl scout that made the website.

## Our Tools

We will be utilizing Replit and Github to complete this work.
You are welcome to work locally, however, this is ill-advised.
There are some quirks when working locally and it will save you some time to work strictly on Replit.

## How to Contribute

When working on this learning template, we want to ensure that all parties are getting a taste of what it would be like to work on a professional team. 
It is not enough to just contribute code, you will need to review your peers' code as well.

For version control in Replit, watch this [Loom recording to see how to contribute your edits](https://www.loom.com/share/a75ab38904184ef49d70e6f578756ad9?sid=8b5e1d50-01da-4773-bdc6-a225a47c524c).

### Rules for contributing code/working

1. **Never, never, work off of main. Always make sure you are on your branch.**
1. We will assign issues to whomever will be doing the work.
1. To confirm which branch you should be on, check the linked branch that is in your assigned issue.
1. When you are on the Replit browser, check which branch you are on with the Git tab.
1. If you are on the wrong branch, find the correct one and click on it. That should automatically switch you to that branch.
1. When you are ready to commit your work, add a meaning full message that describes the work you did
1. Click "Push"
1. Confirm in Github that your commit is reflected by creating a new Pull Request with a target into `main`. You should see a side-by-side window showing your updates.
1.. You do not need to wait until your work is complete to make a commit. You can make as many commits as you would like before creating a pull request.
1.. You can also create a pull request before your work is complete.
1.. When you are ready to have your code reviewed, add the "Ready for Review" tag to it.

### Rules for code review

1. **Never, never click the "merge" button**
2. Be respectful! Add only constructive criticism or compliments.
3. No question is too dumb, silly, whatever. Ask whatever you have on your mind.
4. If you think there is a better way to approach the solution, say it! This is a place where all ideas are heard.

If you have questions/concerns, reach out to [Ryan](rlay@ucsd.edu) or [Lina](lina@codewithher.org) or message us on slack.
